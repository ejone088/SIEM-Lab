# SIEM-Lab
I will be creating a VM in the cloud (Microsoft Azure) and using it as a honeypot to draw attackers while using Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) to observe logging information generated by the VM as it is attacked.

While creating the Windows VM, I am going to reconfigure the default firewall rule in place and create a new one to essentially open the VM to all traffic on the internet
